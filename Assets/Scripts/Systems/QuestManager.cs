    CLOUD SAVE INTEGRATION - TO BE IMPLEMENTED LATER
    ================================================================================
    
    When implementing user accounts and cloud save, replace the above save/load methods
    with cloud-based storage. This will enable cross-device sync and data backup.
    
    Example implementation structure:
    
    public async Task SaveQuestsToCloud(string userId)
    {
        try
        {
            var questData = new QuestSaveData
            {
                generationTime = _generationTime,
                customQuests = customQuests,
                saveTimestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
                version = "1.0"
            };
            
            string jsonData = JsonUtility.ToJson(questData);
            await CloudSaveManager.Instance.SaveData(userId, "quests", jsonData);
            
            // Also save locally as backup
            SaveQuests();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Debug.LogError($"Cloud save failed: {e.Message}");
            // Fall back to local save only
            SaveQuests();
        }
    }
    
    public async Task LoadQuestsFromCloud(string userId)
    {
        try
        {
            string jsonData = await CloudSaveManager.Instance.LoadData(userId, "quests");
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(jsonData))
            {
                var questData = JsonUtility.FromJson<QuestSaveData>(jsonData);

                customQuests = questData.customQuests;
            }
            else
            {
                // No cloud data, load from local storage
